#Registry



We are so happy to celebrate our wedding with you! And we want to thank you in advance for your gift! You may know that we are currently living in two different cities, Tara in LA and Jens in Oakland - a temporary living situation because of work. Because of our distance we're going to skip the traditional gifts for our registry. Instead we would love if you would instead consider donating to either our family fund, or to either of two non-profit organization that have special meaning in our lives.

## Spiral Q Puppet Theater
As an intern at Spiral Q six years ago I learned not only skills related to parade art, but I learned how art can inspire a community, bring together people from all walks of life, and make people feel poweful and big (literally!) 

Thank you for your donation!
