#Registry



We are so happy to celebrate our wedding with you! And we want to thank you in advance for your gift! You may know that we are currently living in two different cities, Tara in LA and Jens in Oakland - a temporary living situation for work. Because of our distance we're going to skip the traditional gifts for our registry. Instead we would love if you would consider donating to either our family fund, or to either of two non-profit organizations that have special meaning in our lives.   
   



### Donate!



[**Jens and Tara Family Fund!**](http://paypal.me/taraandjens)   
Donations towards our family fund will go towards just that - funding our new family!   
(Think honeymoon expenses, moving, education, etc!)   

For mail please use:  
the Jahnkes c/o the von der Lindens  
PO 234
Rocky Hill, NJ 08553-0234
   
[**Spiral Q Puppet Theater!**](http://www.spiralq.org/)   
As an intern at Spiral Q six years ago I learned not only skills related to parade art,   
but I learned how art can inspire a community, bring together people from all walks of life,   
and make people feel poweful and big (literally!) 

Thank you!   
Tara   
   

[**Software Carpentry**](http://software-carpentry.org/)   
Software Carpentry taught me how to build, use, validate and share software well.
As an instructor I help fellow scientists achieve more in less time.   

Thank you for your donation!   
Jens
