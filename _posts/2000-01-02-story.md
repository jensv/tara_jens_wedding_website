# How we met

# The Proposal
April 2015 was a big month for Tara. She was graduating with her MFA from DigiPen and moving to Los Angeles to start working as a Disney Imagineer. Little did she know that I was preparing the most important event. I planned to propose to her the week of her graduation. However, it took me longer to find the courage and to get hold  of her twin sister, who lives in new Jersey, her two older sisters who live in Chicago and Baltimore, her father, who lives in DC and brother, who is teaching English in Cambodia. After I had received blessing from the everyone, Tara was already in California and my time was limited to our biweekly visits to each other. On first visit back to Seattle I suggested we take the water taxi to west Seattle, something that was on our bucket list for a long time. As we sat down on the water taxi, I was quite relieved to notice that the boat was mostly empty. Then a couple sat down right behind us and heightened my anxiety. Tara said are you going to propose now? I was shocked, did she know? I said "No" the most sincere way I could. Once the boat was in motion I told Tara there was a reason I wanted to take the water taxi today. I grabbed the ring in my jacket pocket, got down on my knees and said "Tara I love you and want to spend my whole life with you! Will you marry me?". She said "Yes!" To our great surprise no one on the boat noticed, everyone seemed to be looking at their phones. We got off and took our engagement picture.
