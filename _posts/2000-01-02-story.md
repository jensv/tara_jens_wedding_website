# How we met
My twin sister Leanna is the reason Jens and I met (there I said it, happy Leanna?) Really, I just turned around one day and Jens was there. He was smiling, a big bright smile, and he seemed happy to see me. I was at my first meeting at University of Pennsylvania’s chapter of Alpha Phi Omega (APO), a co-ed community service fraternity. I did not attend UPenn, and really had no reason to join the fraternity, but I was trying to meet new people and Leanna encouraged me to try APO. I’m glad she did, and she certainly does deserve credit for how Jens and I met. About 20 minutes into the fraternity mix and mingle I was ready to leave and write a big check mark next to APO on my, ‘things to try,’ list. I went over to Leanna and said something just like that. She said gave me a firm turn around and said, ‘Go meet people, here, meet, Jens.” And there was Jens, smiling. We talked, about nothing in particular, but as we talked I knew we were going to be friends. It took a few more months, many more conversations, and an official date at a German style Carnival Party for us to actually begin our relationship together (and that is not thanks to Leanna).

# The Proposal
May 2015 was a big month for Tara. She was graduating with her MFA and moving to Los Angeles to start working as a Disney Imagineer. Little did she know that I was preparing the most important event. I planned to propose to her the week of her graduation. However, I wanted to get blessings from each one of her family members. And with a big family like Tara has, it took me longer than planned to get hold of her father, who lives in DC, her twin sister, who lives in new Jersey, her two older sisters who live in Chicago and Baltimore, and her brother, who is teaching English in Cambodia. After I had received blessing from everyone, Tara was already in California and my time to propose was limited to our biweekly visits to each other. On her first visit back to Seattle I suggested to Tara that we take the water taxi to west Seattle, something that was on our Seattle bucket list for a long time. As we sat down on the water taxi, I was quite relieved to notice that the boat was mostly empty. Then, of course, a couple sat down right behind us and heightened my anxiety. But we had such a beautiful view of the water and I really was ready. Once the boat was in motion I told Tara there was a reason I wanted to take the water taxi today. I took the ring out from my jacket pocket, got down on one knee and said "Tara I love you and want to spend my whole life with you! Will you marry me?". She said "Yes, of course!" To our great surprise no one on the boat noticed, everyone seemed to be looking at their phones. We got off and took a photo of us and the water taxi to remember the moment (with the typical Seattle day in the background).
